# ARC-Prometheus üî•

**AI Civilization for Solving ARC Prize through Evolutionary LLM Agents**

ARC-Prometheus is an ambitious project that simulates how human scientists solve problems: diverse specialists collaborating, experimenting, and building on each other's work through evolutionary pressure. Instead of building a single "super-intelligent" AI, we're creating an ecosystem of specialized LLM agents that evolve solutions to the [ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) challenge.

## üéØ Project Vision

Modern deep learning fails at ARC because it requires millions of examples, while ARC provides only ~3 training examples per task. This project takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **The Crucible („Çã„Å§„Åº)**: Sandbox environment for safe code execution and validation
- **The Cognitive Cells (Ë™çÁü•ÁöÑÁ¥∞ËÉû)**: Specialized LLM agent teams (Analyst, Programmer, Refiner, Tagger)
- **The Evolutionary Engine (ÈÄ≤ÂåñÁöÑ„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥)**: Evolution mechanisms (Mutation, Crossover, Fitness Function)

### Why This Matters

ARC Prize tests **abstraction and reasoning** - the ability to learn underlying transformation rules from just 3 examples and apply them to never-before-seen problems. This is the essence of human intelligence and a critical step toward AGI.

**Current Status**: Phase 1.1 Complete ‚úÖ
- Data loading and visualization
- Grid evaluation
- Infrastructure foundation

**Next**: Phase 1.2 - Manual solver and safe execution sandbox

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üìö Usage

### Phase 1.1: Data Loading Demo

Run the demo script to see data loading and grid visualization:

```bash
# Use default task (first in dataset)
python scripts/demo_phase1_1_data.py

# Use specific task ID
python scripts/demo_phase1_1_data.py 007bbfb7
```

**Expected output**:
- Colored grid visualization for train examples
- Input/output comparisons
- Test examples (puzzles to solve)
- Evaluation demo showing grid comparison

### Phase 1.2: Manual Solver Demo

Run the manual solver demo to see validation with task 05269061:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase1_2_manual.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Manual solver solves all 3 train examples (100% success rate)
- Predicted vs expected output comparison with colored grids
- Success message: "üéâ SUCCESS: Manual solver works perfectly!"

**What it demonstrates**:
- Manually-written solver using numpy operations
- Diagonal pattern extraction and grid filling
- Infrastructure validation before LLM integration

### Phase 1.3: Safe Execution Sandbox Demo

Run the sandbox demo to see safe execution of untrusted code:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase1_3_sandbox.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Demo 1: Successful execution - Phase 1.2 solver in sandbox (3/3 correct, 100%)
- Demo 2: Timeout enforcement - Infinite loop terminated after 2 seconds
- Demo 3: Exception handling - ZeroDivisionError caught gracefully

**What it demonstrates**:
- Multiprocessing isolation for untrusted code execution
- Timeout enforcement (configurable, default 5 seconds)
- Exception handling (syntax errors, runtime errors)
- Return type validation (must be np.ndarray)
- Integration with Phase 1.2 manual solver

**Security notes**:
- Restricted builtins: eval, exec, compile, open removed
- **Limitation**: Cannot prevent filesystem/network access (multiprocessing limitation)
- **Production**: Use Docker with read-only filesystem and network disabled

### Phase 1.5: End-to-End Pipeline

Run complete AI solver pipeline on any ARC task:

```bash
python scripts/run_phase1_test.py <task_id>

# Example with known tasks
python scripts/run_phase1_test.py 00576224
python scripts/run_phase1_test.py 007bbfb7
python scripts/run_phase1_test.py 025d127b
```

**Expected output**:
- Task loading confirmation with train/test example counts
- LLM-generated solver code display (with line numbers)
- Execution results for each train example with colored grid visualization
- Success rate and performance metrics
- Saved solver file location (if any examples solved correctly)
- Clear error diagnostics with diffs when predictions don't match

**What it demonstrates**:
- Complete orchestration of all Phase 1 components
- Data loading ‚Üí LLM generation ‚Üí Sandbox execution ‚Üí Evaluation
- End-to-end AI civilization capability
- Robust error handling (timeouts, exceptions, mismatches)
- User-friendly output with visual progress tracking

**Note**: LLM-generated code quality varies (inherent randomness). The pipeline correctly handles all scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Successful solver execution and evaluation
- ‚úÖ Code generation failures (missing returns, syntax errors)
- ‚úÖ Runtime errors (division by zero, module imports)
- ‚úÖ Timeout enforcement for infinite loops
- ‚úÖ Grid shape/value mismatches with detailed diffs

### Phase 2.1: Fitness Function Evaluation

Evaluate solver quality with emphasis on generalization over memorization:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase2_1_fitness.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Demo 1: Perfect solver achieving 100% accuracy (fitness = 13)
- Demo 2: Overfitting solver failing on test data (fitness = 3)
- Demo 3: Timeout enforcement with infinite loop (fitness = 0)
- Clear breakdown of train vs test performance
- Analysis of generalization capability

**What it demonstrates**:
- Fitness calculation: `(train_correct √ó 1) + (test_correct √ó 10)`
- 10x weight on test accuracy encourages generalization
- Timeout enforcement prevents infinite loops
- Clear error reporting for failure modes
- Foundation for evolutionary loop (Phase 2.2+)

**Key insight**: A solver with 100% train accuracy but 0% test accuracy (pure overfitting) receives fitness = 3, while a solver with lower train but some test accuracy can score higher. This prioritizes solvers that learn underlying rules rather than memorizing examples.

### Phase 2.2: Refiner Agent (Code Debugging)

Automatically debug and improve failed solver code through LLM-based refinement:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase2_2_refiner.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Demo 1: Syntax error fixed (fitness 0 ‚Üí 13, +13 improvement)
- Demo 2: Logic error corrected (fitness 0 ‚Üí 13, +13 improvement)
- Demo 3: Infinite loop optimized (fitness 0 ‚Üí 13, +13 improvement)
- Clear before/after fitness comparison with line-numbered code
- Progress indicators during Gemini API calls
- Summary showing total fitness gain across all scenarios

**What it demonstrates**:
- LLM-based code debugging with error analysis
- First evolutionary mechanism (Mutation) - automated code refinement
- Fitness improvement through iterative debugging
- Handles syntax errors, logic errors, and performance issues
- Foundation for evolution loop (Phase 2.3)

**Key features**:
- Uses Gemini API with temperature 0.4 (debugging creativity)
- Analyzes fitness results to identify failure patterns
- Generates corrected code with proper numpy-only constraints
- Re-evaluates refined code to verify improvement
- Tested with real API: 3/3 scenarios successful (100%)

### Phase 2.3: Evolution Loop

Run multi-generation solver evolution combining all Phase 2 components:

```bash
# Run with default configuration
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py

# Use custom model (e.g., thinking model for complex tasks)
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py --model gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp

# Adjust creativity with custom temperatures
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py --programmer-temperature 0.5 --refiner-temperature 0.6

# Run more generations for difficult tasks
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py --max-generations 10

# Combine multiple options
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py \
  --model gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp \
  --max-generations 10 \
  --programmer-temperature 0.5 \
  --refiner-temperature 0.6

# See all available options
python scripts/demo_phase2_3_evolution.py --help
```

**Configuration Options**:
- `--model MODEL`: LLM model name (default: gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
- `--programmer-temperature TEMP`: Code generation creativity, 0.0-2.0 (default: 0.3)
- `--refiner-temperature TEMP`: Debugging creativity, 0.0-2.0 (default: 0.4)

- Demo 2: Early convergence (perfect solver from start)
- Demo 3: Gradual improvement (up to 5 generations)
- Generation-by-generation fitness tracking
- Total improvement and timing statistics
- Analysis of evolution patterns (convergence, plateau, etc.)

- Multi-generation tracking with improvement metrics
- Early termination when target fitness reached (efficiency)
- Graceful handling of plateau scenarios (no improvement)
- Foundation for Phase 3 (population-based evolution)

## üî¨ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Prototype (Current)
**Goal**: Build minimal ecosystem for end-to-end ARC task solving

- [x] **1.1**: Environment setup + data loading ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2**: Manual solver validation ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.3**: Safe execution sandbox ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.4**: LLM-based code generation (gemini-2.5-flash-lite) ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.5**: Complete end-to-end pipeline ‚úÖ

**Success Criteria**: AI-generated code solves ‚â•1 train pair

### Phase 2: Evolutionary Loop ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement mutation and selection pressure

- [x] **2.1**: Fitness function evaluation ‚úÖ
- [x] **2.2**: Refiner agent for debugging ‚úÖ
- [x] **2.3**: Multi-generation evolution loop ‚úÖ

### Phase 3: Scaling and Crossover (Planned)
**Goal**: Full ARC dataset with genetic operations

- Solver library (SQLite ‚Üí Cloud DB)
- Tagger for technique classification
- Crossover agent for capability fusion
- Distributed task queue (Celery/RabbitMQ)

## üß™ Technical Details

### ARC Dataset Format

Tasks are JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "train": [
    {"input": [[0,1,2], ...], "output": [[3,4,5], ...]},
    ...
  ],
  "test": [
    {"input": [[...]], "output": [[...]] (optional)}
  ]
}
```

Grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9) representing colors.

### Solver Function Signature

All generated solvers must follow this exact signature:
```python
def solve(task_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Transform input grid according to inferred rule.
    Must use only numpy for array operations.
    """
    pass
```

### Safe Execution Protocol

- All LLM-generated code runs in isolated `multiprocessing.Process`
- Default timeout: 5 seconds per execution
- Return format: `tuple[bool, Optional[np.ndarray]]`
  - `(True, result_grid)` on successful execution
  - `(False, None)` on failure/timeout/exception

### Fitness Evaluation Priority

**Critical**: Test accuracy is weighted 10x higher than train accuracy

```python
Fitness = (train_correct * 1) + (test_correct * 10)
```

**Why?** Solvers that only work on training examples have memorized patterns instead of learning the underlying transformation rule. This defeats the core ARC challenge: abstract reasoning with unseen problems.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Running Tests (TDD Approach)

This project follows Test-Driven Development:

1. Write tests first (in `tests/`)
2. Run tests and watch them fail
3. Implement feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor if needed

```bash
# Watch mode (requires pytest-watch)
ptw tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/arc_prometheus --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Code Quality

We use a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks:

**Available Commands** (via Makefile):

```bash
# Run all CI checks at once
make ci

# Individual checks
make test          # Run test suite
make test-cov      # Run tests with coverage report
make typecheck     # Type checking with mypy
make lint          # Linting with ruff
make lint-fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
make format        # Format code
make format-check  # Check formatting without changes
make security      # Security scanning with bandit
make clean         # Clean cache files
make help          # Show all available commands
```

**Quality Tools**:
- **mypy**: Strict type checking (Python 3.13)
- **ruff**: Fast linting and formatting (replaces black, flake8, isort)
- **pytest**: Test framework with coverage reporting
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning

**Pre-commit Hooks** (Optional):

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks to run checks before each commit
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
- Automated checks run on all PRs via GitHub Actions
- Type checking, linting, formatting, security, and tests
- All checks must pass before merging

### Commit Convention

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: bug fix`
- `docs: documentation updates`
- `test: add or update tests`
- `refactor: code refactoring`

- **Code Quality Constants Extraction** (Phase 1.5 PR Review): Extract magic numbers to named constants at module level (`SANDBOX_TIMEOUT = 5`, `PREVIEW_START_LINES = 20`). Improves maintainability and makes configuration explicit. Applied to timeout values and display parameters.
- **Empty Grid Safety Checks** (Phase 1.5 PR Review): Always validate `result_grid.size > 0` before array operations like `np.argwhere()`. Empty grids can cause IndexError. Add explicit `len(diff_positions) > 0` checks and use `int()` conversions for safety.
- **Pytest Fixture for Path Deduplication** (Phase 1.5 PR Review): When multiple tests construct same path, extract to `@pytest.fixture`. Eliminates 6-line duplication across tests and provides single source of truth.
- **File Encoding Specification** (Phase 1.5 PR Review): Always specify `encoding="utf-8"` in `open()` for cross-platform compatibility. Platform default encodings vary (Windows cp1252, Linux/Mac UTF-8).
- **E2E Pipeline Orchestration** (Phase 1.5): Chain components with comprehensive error handling at each stage. Show progressive feedback (load ‚Üí generate ‚Üí execute ‚Üí evaluate). Never let early failures prevent reporting partial results.
- **User-Friendly CLI Output** (Phase 1.5): Use consistent visual formatting (‚ïê ‚îÄ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è) and progressive disclosure. Show what's happening at each step with timing info for transparency.
- **Solver Persistence Strategy** (Phase 1.5): Save generated code even with partial success (‚â•1 correct) - valuable for Phase 2 mutation and debugging. Include metadata (task_id, success_rate, timestamp) in saved files.
- **LLM Variability Acceptance** (Phase 1.5): LLM code generation is inherently variable. Build robust pipelines that handle all scenarios: success, syntax errors, runtime exceptions, incomplete code, constraint violations (e.g., scipy import). The pipeline's robustness matters more than individual LLM success.
- **Mock Patch at Import Level** (Phase 1.4): When mocking functions in tests, patch where they're imported, not where defined. `@patch("programmer.get_api_key")` not `@patch("utils.config.get_api_key")`. Mock must be active before function execution.
- **Temperature for Code Generation** (Phase 1.4): Research shows lower temps (0.2-0.3) produce more consistent, deterministic code than default 0.7. LLMs with high temperature generate creative but unreliable code.
- **Multi-Strategy Code Parsing** (Phase 1.4): Chain extraction strategies with fallbacks: Strategy 1 (markdown ``` blocks) ‚Üí Strategy 2 (indentation-based raw code) ‚Üí Strategy 3 (error). Indentation-based detection more robust than keyword matching.
- **Security Warnings in User Tools** (Phase 1.4): Always warn users about limitations in user-facing tools. Demo script now includes clear warning that multiprocessing sandbox doesn't prevent filesystem/network access (Docker needed for production).
- **Enhanced Error Messages** (Phase 1.4): Show first 300 + last 200 chars of response (not just first 500) for better debugging when parsing fails. Helps identify if issue is at start or end of response.
- **Decorator Detection in Code Parser** (Phase 1.4): Add "@" to Python statement detection to prevent premature termination when decorators present before function definitions.
- **Builtins Bypass Security** (Phase 1.3): Restricting `__builtins__` dict insufficient - code can bypass via `import builtins; builtins.eval(...)`. Must replace `sys.modules["builtins"]` with restricted module. Added test to verify bypass prevention.
- **Queue.empty() Unreliability** (Phase 1.3): `multiprocessing.Queue.empty()` has race conditions - feeder thread may not have transferred data when checked. Always use `get_nowait()` with try/except instead.
- **Security as Module Constants** (Phase 1.3): Extract security restrictions (dangerous functions, blocked keywords) as module-level frozenset constants for maintainability and clarity.
- **Systematic PR Review** (Phase 1.3): /fix_pr_graphql command successfully addressed all 5 reviewers' feedback systematically - critical security issues fixed, all CI checks passing.
- **AI Code Reviewer Verification** (PR #7): gemini-code-assist claimed all pre-commit hook versions were invalid (v0.14.2, v1.18.2, 1.8.0, v5.0.0), but GitHub API verification showed all versions exist. Always verify factual claims before accepting reviewer feedback. Correctness > Compliance.
- **Type Checking Environment Differences** (PR #7): CI has numpy type stubs (np.array_equal returns bool), local doesn't (returns Any). Using `cast(bool, ...)` triggered "redundant cast" error in CI. Solution: `bool(...)` works in both environments.
- **Dependency Verification** (PR #7): Always verify package existence before adding to dependencies. `types-python-dotenv` doesn't exist - python-dotenv doesn't provide type stubs. Use `ignore_missing_imports = true` in mypy instead.
- **CI/CD Failure Iteration** (PR #7): Systematic approach - fetch logs ‚Üí identify exact error ‚Üí verify locally ‚Üí fix ‚Üí test with `make ci` ‚Üí push ‚Üí monitor. GraphQL fetches ALL PR feedback in single query.
- **Critical Thinking in Code Review** (Phase 1.2): When user instructed "don't blindly trust the review", successfully identified that reviewer's "Critical" label on hardcoded 7x7 grid size was incorrect - task 05269061 always uses 7x7 grids, and Phase 1.2's goal is task-specific validation (not general-purpose solver). Added documentation clarification instead of unnecessary refactoring.
- **False Test Coverage Detection** (Phase 1.2): CodeRabbitAI identified critical issue where tests claimed 36/36 passing but most were placeholder `pass` statements that didn't actually validate anything. Complete rewrite added real assertions and integration tests.
- **Diagonal Pattern Recognition** (Phase 1.2): ARC task 05269061 requires grouping values by diagonal index (`row + col`), then applying rotation rules based on diagonal position (consecutive vs non-consecutive, top-left vs bottom-right). Iterative pattern analysis with real data was essential.
- **TDD Iteration Speed** (Phase 1.2): Writing tests first accelerated debugging - pattern mismatches were immediately visible, leading to 5 refinement cycles before achieving 100% accuracy.
- **Manual Solver as Validation** (Phase 1.2): Implementing a working solver before LLM integration validates that:
  1. The task is solvable with pure numpy
  2. `evaluate_grids()` correctly identifies matches
  3. The solver signature (`def solve(np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`) works as designed
- **Lazy Validation Pattern** (Phase 1.1): API key validation converted from eager to lazy - enables Phase 1.1-1.2 features to work without Gemini API setup.
- **Enhanced load_task()** (Phase 1.1): Added optional `task_id` parameter to load from collection files directly.
- **ARC Evaluation Format Handling** (Phase 2.1): Test examples in ARC evaluation tasks often lack "output" keys. Always check `if "output" not in example:` before accessing. Skip invalid examples gracefully and only count evaluable examples in train_total/test_total.
- **Explicit NumPy dtype Casting** (Phase 2.1): Always specify `dtype=np.int64` in `np.array()` calls to ensure type consistency across grid operations. Prevents subtle type mismatches in grid comparisons.
- **Fitness Function 10x Weight Rationale** (Phase 2.1): Test accuracy weighted 10x higher than train (`fitness = train_correct * 1 + test_correct * 10`) ensures evolutionary pressure favors generalization over memorization. A solver with 100% train but 0% test (pure overfitting) scores only 3 points vs solver with partial generalization scoring higher.
- **Test Count Validation in CI** (Phase 2.1): Update test count assertions in README after adding new tests. Changed from `==` to `<=` for test_total when handling variable test example counts (due to missing outputs).
- **TypedDict for Type Safety** (Phase 2.2): Define structured dict types with TypedDict instead of generic `dict[str, Any]`. Provides better IDE autocomplete and type checking. Example: `FitnessResult` TypedDict for fitness evaluation results.
- **Type Annotation Environment Differences** (Phase 2.2): CI and local environments may have different type stub availability. When type checking passes locally but fails in CI, use `typing.Any` for parameters with environment-dependent type information. Avoids `type: ignore` comments that appear "unused" locally but are needed in CI.
- **Prompt Output Format Clarity** (Phase 2.2): LLM prompts should acknowledge parser flexibility. Instead of "Do NOT include code blocks", use "You may optionally wrap code in ```python blocks, but raw code is preferred". Aligns prompts with actual parser behavior that handles both formats.
- **Resource Cleanup Fallback Pattern** (Phase 2.2): When cleaning up temp files, provide fallback logic in finally blocks. Check both the intended variable and the original file handle to ensure cleanup even if early exceptions occur.
- **Systematic Code Review Addressing** (Phase 2.2): Prioritize review feedback by severity (Critical ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low). Address medium and critical issues immediately. Document low-priority issues for follow-up work. Used TodoWrite tool to track 7 review issues systematically.
- **CI Type Error Resolution** (Phase 2.2): When mypy passes locally but fails in CI due to type stubs, check if the library has different stub availability. Use `typing.Any` for cross-environment compatibility instead of platform-specific type annotations.
