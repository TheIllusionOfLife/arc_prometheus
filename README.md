# ARC-Prometheus üî•

**AI Civilization for Solving ARC Prize through Evolutionary LLM Agents**

ARC-Prometheus is an ambitious project that simulates how human scientists solve problems: diverse specialists collaborating, experimenting, and building on each other's work through evolutionary pressure. Instead of building a single "super-intelligent" AI, we're creating an ecosystem of specialized LLM agents that evolve solutions to the [ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) challenge.

## üéØ Project Vision

Modern deep learning fails at ARC because it requires millions of examples, while ARC provides only ~3 training examples per task. This project takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **The Crucible („Çã„Å§„Åº)**: Sandbox environment for safe code execution and validation
- **The Cognitive Cells (Ë™çÁü•ÁöÑÁ¥∞ËÉû)**: Specialized LLM agent teams (Analyst, Programmer, Refiner, Tagger)
- **The Evolutionary Engine (ÈÄ≤ÂåñÁöÑ„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥)**: Evolution mechanisms (Mutation, Crossover, Fitness Function)

### Why This Matters

ARC Prize tests **abstraction and reasoning** - the ability to learn underlying transformation rules from just 3 examples and apply them to never-before-seen problems. This is the essence of human intelligence and a critical step toward AGI.

**Current Status**: Phase 1.1 Complete ‚úÖ
- Data loading and visualization
- Grid evaluation
- Infrastructure foundation

**Next**: Phase 1.2 - Manual solver and safe execution sandbox

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Gemini API key ([get one here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- ARC Prize 2025 dataset ([download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025/data))

## üìö Usage

### Phase 1.1: Data Loading Demo

Run the demo script to see data loading and grid visualization:

```bash
# Use default task (first in dataset)
python scripts/demo_phase1_1_data.py

# Use specific task ID
python scripts/demo_phase1_1_data.py 007bbfb7
```

**Expected output**:
- Colored grid visualization for train examples
- Input/output comparisons
- Test examples (puzzles to solve)
- Evaluation demo showing grid comparison

### Phase 1.2: Manual Solver Demo

Run the manual solver demo to see validation with task 05269061:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase1_2_manual.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Manual solver solves all 3 train examples (100% success rate)
- Predicted vs expected output comparison with colored grids
- Success message: "üéâ SUCCESS: Manual solver works perfectly!"

**What it demonstrates**:
- Manually-written solver using numpy operations
- Diagonal pattern extraction and grid filling
- Infrastructure validation before LLM integration

### Phase 1.3: Safe Execution Sandbox Demo

Run the sandbox demo to see safe execution of untrusted code:

```bash
python scripts/demo_phase1_3_sandbox.py
```

**Expected output**:
- Demo 1: Successful execution - Phase 1.2 solver in sandbox (3/3 correct, 100%)
- Demo 2: Timeout enforcement - Infinite loop terminated after 2 seconds
- Demo 3: Exception handling - ZeroDivisionError caught gracefully

**What it demonstrates**:
- Multiprocessing isolation for untrusted code execution
- Timeout enforcement (configurable, default 5 seconds)
- Exception handling (syntax errors, runtime errors)
- Return type validation (must be np.ndarray)
- Integration with Phase 1.2 manual solver

**Security notes**:
- Restricted builtins: eval, exec, compile, open removed
- **Limitation**: Cannot prevent filesystem/network access (multiprocessing limitation)
- **Production**: Use Docker with read-only filesystem and network disabled

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_data_loader.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/arc_prometheus --cov-report=html
```

## üî¨ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Prototype (Current)
**Goal**: Build minimal ecosystem for end-to-end ARC task solving

- [x] **1.1**: Environment setup + data loading ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2**: Manual solver validation ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.3**: Safe execution sandbox ‚úÖ
- [ ] **1.4**: LLM-based code generation
- [ ] **1.5**: Complete end-to-end pipeline

**Success Criteria**: AI-generated code solves ‚â•1 train pair

### Phase 2: Evolutionary Loop (Planned)
**Goal**: Implement mutation and selection pressure

- Fitness function: `(train_correct * 1) + (test_correct * 10)`
- Refiner agent for debugging
- Multi-generation evolution
- Test accuracy tracking

### Phase 3: Scaling and Crossover (Planned)
**Goal**: Full ARC dataset with genetic operations

- Solver library (SQLite ‚Üí Cloud DB)
- Tagger for technique classification
- Crossover agent for capability fusion
- Distributed task queue (Celery/RabbitMQ)

## üß™ Technical Details

### ARC Dataset Format

Tasks are JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "train": [
    {"input": [[0,1,2], ...], "output": [[3,4,5], ...]},
    ...
  ],
  "test": [
    {"input": [[...]], "output": [[...]] (optional)}
  ]
}
```

Grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9) representing colors.

### Solver Function Signature

All generated solvers must follow this exact signature:
```python
def solve(task_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Transform input grid according to inferred rule.
    Must use only numpy for array operations.
    """
    pass
```

### Safe Execution Protocol

- All LLM-generated code runs in isolated `multiprocessing.Process`
- Default timeout: 5 seconds per execution
- Return format: `tuple[bool, Optional[np.ndarray]]`
  - `(True, result_grid)` on successful execution
  - `(False, None)` on failure/timeout/exception

### Fitness Evaluation Priority

**Critical**: Test accuracy is weighted 10x higher than train accuracy

```python
Fitness = (train_correct * 1) + (test_correct * 10)
```

**Why?** Solvers that only work on training examples have memorized patterns instead of learning the underlying transformation rule. This defeats the core ARC challenge: abstract reasoning with unseen problems.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Running Tests (TDD Approach)

This project follows Test-Driven Development:

1. Write tests first (in `tests/`)
2. Run tests and watch them fail
3. Implement feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor if needed

```bash
# Watch mode (requires pytest-watch)
ptw tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/arc_prometheus --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Code Quality

We use a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks:

**Available Commands** (via Makefile):

```bash
# Run all CI checks at once
make ci

# Individual checks
make test          # Run test suite
make test-cov      # Run tests with coverage report
make typecheck     # Type checking with mypy
make lint          # Linting with ruff
make lint-fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
make format        # Format code
make format-check  # Check formatting without changes
make security      # Security scanning with bandit
make clean         # Clean cache files
make help          # Show all available commands
```

**Quality Tools**:
- **mypy**: Strict type checking (Python 3.13)
- **ruff**: Fast linting and formatting (replaces black, flake8, isort)
- **pytest**: Test framework with coverage reporting
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning

**Pre-commit Hooks** (Optional):

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks to run checks before each commit
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
- Automated checks run on all PRs via GitHub Actions
- Type checking, linting, formatting, security, and tests
- All checks must pass before merging

### Commit Convention

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: bug fix`
- `docs: documentation updates`
- `test: add or update tests`
- `refactor: code refactoring`

## ü§ù Contributing

#### Known Issues / Blockers
- None - CI/CD infrastructure complete, ready for Phase 1.3

#### Session Learnings
- **AI Code Reviewer Verification** (PR #7): gemini-code-assist claimed all pre-commit hook versions were invalid (v0.14.2, v1.18.2, 1.8.0, v5.0.0), but GitHub API verification showed all versions exist. Always verify factual claims before accepting reviewer feedback. Correctness > Compliance.
- **Type Checking Environment Differences** (PR #7): CI has numpy type stubs (np.array_equal returns bool), local doesn't (returns Any). Using `cast(bool, ...)` triggered "redundant cast" error in CI. Solution: `bool(...)` works in both environments.
- **Dependency Verification** (PR #7): Always verify package existence before adding to dependencies. `types-python-dotenv` doesn't exist - python-dotenv doesn't provide type stubs. Use `ignore_missing_imports = true` in mypy instead.
- **CI/CD Failure Iteration** (PR #7): Systematic approach - fetch logs ‚Üí identify exact error ‚Üí verify locally ‚Üí fix ‚Üí test with `make ci` ‚Üí push ‚Üí monitor. GraphQL fetches ALL PR feedback in single query.
- **Critical Thinking in Code Review** (Phase 1.2): When user instructed "don't blindly trust the review", successfully identified that reviewer's "Critical" label on hardcoded 7x7 grid size was incorrect - task 05269061 always uses 7x7 grids, and Phase 1.2's goal is task-specific validation (not general-purpose solver). Added documentation clarification instead of unnecessary refactoring.
- **False Test Coverage Detection** (Phase 1.2): CodeRabbitAI identified critical issue where tests claimed 36/36 passing but most were placeholder `pass` statements that didn't actually validate anything. Complete rewrite added real assertions and integration tests.
- **Diagonal Pattern Recognition** (Phase 1.2): ARC task 05269061 requires grouping values by diagonal index (`row + col`), then applying rotation rules based on diagonal position (consecutive vs non-consecutive, top-left vs bottom-right). Iterative pattern analysis with real data was essential.
- **TDD Iteration Speed** (Phase 1.2): Writing tests first accelerated debugging - pattern mismatches were immediately visible, leading to 5 refinement cycles before achieving 100% accuracy.
- **Manual Solver as Validation** (Phase 1.2): Implementing a working solver before LLM integration validates that:
  1. The task is solvable with pure numpy
  2. `evaluate_grids()` correctly identifies matches
  3. The solver signature (`def solve(np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`) works as designed
- **Lazy Validation Pattern** (Phase 1.1): API key validation converted from eager to lazy - enables Phase 1.1-1.2 features to work without Gemini API setup.
- **Enhanced load_task()** (Phase 1.1): Added optional `task_id` parameter to load from collection files directly.
