# Phase 2 Real-World Benchmark - Critical Findings

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Experiment**: Multiprocess Baseline (15 diverse ARC tasks)
**Purpose**: Validate Phase 2 evolution loop before building Phase 3 infrastructure

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**The benchmark revealed critical issues that MUST be addressed before Phase 3:**

### Key Metrics
- ‚úÖ **System Stability**: 100% (15/15 tasks completed without crashes)
- ‚ùå **Solution Quality**: **VERY LOW** (only 20% of tasks achieved any fitness > 0)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Average Fitness**: 0.33 out of possible 13+ (expected minimum 3-5)
- üìä **Error Distribution**: 162 logic errors, 15 syntax errors, 20 validation errors

### Critical Discovery
**The evolution loop is stable but NOT EFFECTIVE at solving ARC tasks.**
Only 3 out of 15 tasks showed ANY correct solutions (00576224, 08ed6ac7, 0a1d4ef5).

## üìä Detailed Results

### Success Rate by Task Type

| Category | Tasks | Fitness > 0 | Success Rate |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Small grids (‚â§10x10) | 5 | 2 | 40% |
| Medium grids (11-20x20) | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| Large grids (>20x20) | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Complex transformations | 3 | 1 | 33% |
| **TOTAL** | **15** | **3** | **20%** |

### Error Analysis

**Total Errors Across All Generations: 197**

1. **Logic Errors**: 162 (82%)
   - Generated code runs but produces wrong output
   - Most common failure mode
   - Indicates Programmer doesn't understand task patterns

2. **Validation Errors**: 20 (10%)
   - Missing `solve()` function
   - Wrong return type (None instead of ndarray)
   - Indicates LLM prompt issues

3. **Syntax Errors**: 15 (8%)
   - Unterminated string literals
   - Missing except/finally blocks
   - Relatively minor compared to logic errors

### Performance Metrics

- **Average Time per Task**: 25.5s
- **Total Benchmark Time**: 382.3s (‚âà6.4 minutes)
- **Generations per Task**: 5 (always ran full 5 - no early termination)

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Programmer Agent Not Learning Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Evidence:**
- 82% of errors are LOGIC errors (code runs but wrong output)
- Even "known-working" tasks from Phase 1 demos failed:
  - Task 05269061: Manual solver existed (100% accuracy) but AI got fitness 0.0
  - Task 025d127b: Known from demos but AI got fitness 0.0

**Root Cause**: Programmer prompt likely needs better:
- Pattern recognition guidance
- Example demonstrations
- Task decomposition strategies

**Impact**: Building Phase 3 (Solver Library, Tagger, Crossover) on this foundation would be wasteful.

### Issue 2: Refiner Not Improving Solutions (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Evidence:**
- Average 5.00 generations (all tasks ran to max)
- No early termination (no task reached target fitness)
- Fitness didn't improve across generations for most tasks

**Root Cause**:
- Refiner receives error details but can't fix logic errors
- May need better error-specific strategies
- Temperature 0.4 might be too low for creative debugging

**Impact**: Evolution loop's core mutation mechanism is broken.

### Issue 3: Grid Size Correlation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Evidence:**
- Small grids: 40% success rate
- Medium/Large grids: 0% success rate

**Root Cause**:
- LLM struggles with larger contexts
- May hit token limits or complexity thresholds

**Recommendation**: Start Phase 3 testing with small grids only.

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Infrastructure Robustness**: 100% completion rate, no crashes
2. **Error Classification**: New error tracking system captured 197 errors across 5 types
3. **Sandbox Performance**: 25.5s average per task is acceptable
4. **Benchmark Tooling**: Scripts worked flawlessly, JSON export clean

---

## üéØ Recommendations

### **DO NOT** Proceed to Phase 3 Yet

**Reasoning**: Building Solver Library, Tagger, and Crossover on top of a system that only solves 20% of tasks would be premature. We'd be storing mostly broken solvers and crossing over failures.

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Programmer Prompt** (Est: 1-2 days)
   - Add pattern recognition examples
   - Improve task decomposition guidance
   - Test with known-working tasks first (05269061, 00576224)
   - Target: 50%+ success rate on small grids

2. **Enhance Refiner Strategy** (Est: 1 day)
   - Implement error-type-specific refiner prompts (we have the infrastructure!)
   - Increase refiner temperature to 0.6-0.7 for more creativity
   - Add explicit "pattern analysis" step before code generation
   - Target: At least 2-3 generations of improvement per task

3. **Re-Benchmark** (Est: 0.5 days)
   - Run same 15 tasks with improved Programmer/Refiner
   - Compare fitness improvements
   - Validate that fixes work

4. **Then Consider Phase 3** (Only if re-benchmark shows ‚â•40% success rate)

### Alternative: Reduce Scope for Phase 3

If fixing Programmer/Refiner takes too long, consider:
- Start Phase 3 with **small grids only** (‚â§10x10)
- Focus on rotation/symmetry patterns (simpler)
- Build infrastructure while continuing to improve agents

## üìÅ Deliverables

‚úÖ **Benchmark Results**: `results/multiprocess_baseline/`
- 15 task result JSONs
- summary.json with aggregate statistics
- metadata.json with experiment configuration

‚úÖ **Analysis Tools**: `scripts/analyze_benchmark.py`
- Markdown report generation
- Comparison capabilities
- Ready for Phase 3 testing

‚úÖ **Documentation**: This report + inline task comments

## üîë Key Takeaway

**This benchmark saved us 6+ weeks of wasted Phase 3 development.**

Without this validation, we would have built Solver Library, Tagger, and Crossover only to discover they're operating on a foundation that doesn't work. Now we can fix the core issues first.

**The vision is sound. The infrastructure is solid. The prompts need work.**

**Next Action**: Review findings ‚Üí Decide: Fix Programmer/Refiner vs. Proceed to Phase 3 with reduced scope.
