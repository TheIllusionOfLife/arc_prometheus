# ARC-Prometheus Phase 2 Benchmark Tasks
# Selected for diversity in size, complexity, and transformation types
#
# Selection criteria:
# - Varied grid sizes: small (≤10x10), medium (11-20x20), large (>20x20)
# - Varied train example counts: few (2-3), typical (3-4), many (5+)
# - Mix of same-size and different-size transformations
# - Known working tasks (from demos) plus untested tasks

# Small grids (≤10x10)
00576224  # 2x2→6x6, 2 train - known working (Phase 1 demo)
05269061  # 7x7→7x7, 3 train - known working (Phase 1.2 manual solver)
025d127b  # 8x9→8x9, 2 train - known working (Phase 1 demo)
08ed6ac7  # 9x9→9x9, 2 train - untested
0520fde7  # 3x7→3x3, 3 train - size reduction transformation

# Medium grids (11-20x20)
070dd51e  # 20x10→20x10, 2 train - rectangular grid
09629e4f  # 11x11→11x11, 4 train - untested
09c534e7  # 20x20→20x20, 3 train - larger square grid
0607ce86  # 21x22→21x22, 3 train - very large rectangular

# Large grids (>20x20)

05a7bcf2  # 30x30→30x30, 3 train - maximum size grid
06df4c85  # 23x23→23x23, 3 train - large square

# Complex transformations
007bbfb7  # 3x3→9x9, 5 train - size expansion, many examples
0a1d4ef5  # 30x30→2x3, 3 train - extreme size reduction
0bb8deee  # 15x13→6x6, 3 train - size reduction with cropping
