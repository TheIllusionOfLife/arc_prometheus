## Project Overview

**ARC-Prometheus** is an AI civilization project designed to solve the ARC Prize (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge through an evolutionary ecosystem of LLM agents.

### Core Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **The Crucible (るつぼ)** - Sandbox environment for ARC puzzle execution and validation
2. **The Cognitive Cells (認知的細胞)** - Specialized LLM agent teams:
   - **Analyst**: Analyzes ARC input/output examples to infer transformation rules
   - **Programmer**: Generates Python solver code based on Analyst specifications
   - **Refiner**: Debugs and improves failed solver code
   - **Tagger** (Phase 3): Identifies techniques used in successful solvers
3. **The Evolutionary Engine (進化的エンジン)** - Evolution mechanisms:
   - **Mutation**: Code refinement through error analysis
   - **Crossover**: Fusion of successful solvers with different capabilities
   - **Fitness Function**: Evaluates solver generalization (prioritizes test accuracy over train)

### Development Philosophy

This project follows a strict Test-Driven Development approach and evolutionary principles:

- **Few-shot learning**: ARC tasks provide only ~3 training examples on average
- **Generalization over memorization**: Test accuracy is weighted 10x higher than train accuracy
- **Emergent intelligence**: Multiple specialized agents collaborate like a scientific community
- **Safe execution**: All generated code runs in sandboxed environments (multiprocessing or Docker)

## Development Phases

## Common Commands

### Environment Setup (Phase 1.1)
```bash
# Download ARC Prize 2025 dataset from Kaggle
# https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025/data

# Install core dependencies
pip install numpy google-generativeai

# Future phases will add:
# pip install multiprocess celery redis pytest
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run Phase 1 end-to-end test (when implemented)
python run_phase1_test.py <path_to_arc_task.json>

# Run unit tests (future)
pytest tests/
```

### Data Format
ARC tasks are JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "train": [
    {"input": [[0,1,2], ...], "output": [[3,4,5], ...]},
    ...
  ],
  "test": [
    {"input": [[...]], "output": [[...]] (optional)}
  ]
}
```
Grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9) representing colors.

**IMPORTANT - ARC Evaluation Format**:
- Training tasks (`arc-agi_training_challenges.json`) have outputs for both train AND test examples
- Evaluation tasks (`arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json`) store test outputs SEPARATELY in `arc-agi_evaluation_solutions.json`
- **Use preprocessing script before benchmarking evaluation data**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/prepare_evaluation_data.py \
    --challenges data/arc-prize-2025/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json \
    --solutions data/arc-prize-2025/arc-agi_evaluation_solutions.json \
    --output data/arc-prize-2025/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges_merged.json
  ```
- Code must handle missing "output" keys gracefully: `if "output" not in example: continue`
- Always use explicit dtype casting: `np.array(example["input"], dtype=np.int64)`

## Code Standards

### Solver Function Signature
All generated solvers must follow this exact signature:
```python
def solve(task_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Transform input grid according to inferred rule.
    Must use only numpy for array operations.
    """
    pass
```
**Note**: Use `np.ndarray` (the type) not `np.array` (the function) for type annotations.

### Safe Execution Protocol

**Sandbox Options**:
- **Multiprocessing** (default): Fast execution with basic isolation
  - Restricted builtins: eval, exec, compile, open removed
  - Timeout enforcement via process termination
  - **Limitation**: Cannot prevent filesystem/network access
- **Docker** (production-grade): Complete container isolation
  - Network disabled (no external communication)
  - Read-only filesystem (except /tmp tmpfs for numpy)
  - Memory limit: 512MB (configurable)
  - CPU limit: 50% of one core (configurable)
  - Process limit: 100 (prevents fork bombs)
  - Non-root user execution (UID 1000)

**Return Format**: `tuple[bool, Optional[np.ndarray], Optional[dict]]`
- `(True, result_grid, None)` on successful execution
- `(False, None, error_detail)` on failure (error_detail includes error_type, error_message, exception_class)

**Usage**:
- Default: `calculate_fitness(task_path, code)` uses multiprocessing
- Production: `calculate_fitness(task_path, code, sandbox_mode="docker")` uses Docker
- CLI: `--sandbox-mode docker` flag for evolution scripts

**Implementation**:
- Both sandboxes implement `ExecutionEnvironment` protocol
- Factory pattern in `fitness.py`: `_get_sandbox(sandbox_mode)` returns appropriate sandbox
- Docker requires: `pip install -e '.[docker]'` and image built via `docker build`

### LLM Integration (Gemini)
- Primary model: Google Gemini API
- Input format: ASCII art grids in prompts
- Expected output: Pure Python code blocks
- Parser must handle:
  - Code wrapped in \`\`\`python ... \`\`\` blocks
  - Raw code without delimiters
  - Multiple code blocks (extract the solve() function)
- Always include "use only numpy" constraint in prompts

**Note**: LLMs often include markdown formatting despite instructions. Implement robust parsing.

### LLM Response Caching
- **Cache location**: `~/.arc_prometheus/llm_cache.db` (SQLite)
- **Enabled by default** in all cognitive cells (Programmer, Refiner)
- **TTL**: 7 days (configurable)
- **Thread-safe**: Uses SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access
- **CLI control**:
  - `--no-cache`: Disable for specific run
  - `--cache-stats`: View hit rate and cost savings
  - `--clear-cache`: Remove all entries
- **Programmatic control**: Use `use_cache=False` parameter in `generate_solver()` and `refine_solver()`
- **Benefits**: 70-80% API cost reduction during development, instant responses for repeated prompts
- **Limitations**:
  - Cache NOT shared across processes
  - Statistics approximate (hit rate slightly inflated)
  - See docstring in `llm_cache.py` for details

### Fitness Evaluation: Prioritize Generalization Over Memorization
**Why Test Accuracy Matters 10x More**: Solvers that only work on training examples fail the core ARC challenge—abstract reasoning with unseen problems. Overfitting to training data means the AI has memorized patterns instead of learning the underlying transformation rule.

**Consequences of Prioritizing Train Accuracy**:
- Solver becomes a "lookup table" for known examples
- Fails completely on novel test cases
- Defeats the purpose of AGI research (generalization is the goal)
- Wastes computational resources on non-generalizable solutions

**Formula**: `Fitness = (train_correct * 1) + (test_correct * 10)`
- Example: 3/3 train + 1/1 test = 13 points (good generalization)
- Example: 3/3 train + 0/1 test = 3 points (pure overfitting)
- Solvers that timeout or crash receive fitness = 0

### Data Persistence (Phase 3)
Solver schema:
```python
{
    "solver_id": str,
    "task_id": str,
    "generation": int,
    "code_str": str,
    "fitness_score": float,
    "train_correct": int,
    "test_correct": int,
    "parent_solver_id": str | None,
    "tags": List[str]  # e.g., ["rotation", "fill", "symmetry"]
}
```

## Important Context

### Why This Approach?
Modern deep learning fails at ARC because it requires millions of examples, while ARC provides only 3. This project simulates how human scientists solve problems: diverse specialists collaborating, experimenting, and building on each other's work through evolutionary pressure.

### Technical Constraints
- **ARC dataset**: ~400 training tasks, ~100 evaluation tasks
- **Grid size**: Typically 3x3 to 30x30
- **Color values**: 0-9 (10 colors total)
- **No external libraries** in generated solvers except numpy
- **Execution safety**: Untrusted LLM code must not access filesystem/network

### Task-Specific vs General-Purpose Solvers
**Important Distinction**: This project has two types of solvers with different purposes:

1. **Task-Specific Validation Solvers** (Phases 1.2-1.3):
   - Manually written for ONE specific ARC task
   - Purpose: Validate infrastructure before LLM integration
   - May use hardcoded constants specific to that task (e.g., 7x7 grids for task 05269061)
   - Example: `scripts/demo_phase1_2_manual.py` - intentionally task-specific
   - **Not a bug**: Hardcoded values are BY DESIGN for validation purposes

2. **General-Purpose LLM-Generated Solvers** (Phase 1.4+):
   - Generated by LLM from task examples
   - Must handle variable grid sizes (3x3 to 30x30)
   - Should generalize to unseen test examples
   - Example: Future output of Programmer agent

**Code Review Guidance**: When reviewing Phase 1.2-1.3 code, task-specific implementations are correct and expected. Only Phase 1.4+ requires general-purpose solvers.

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Solve ≥1 train pair with generated code
- **Phase 2**: Improve test accuracy across generations
- **Phase 3**: Cross-task solver generalization (solver trained on task A solves task B)

## Kaggle Submission (pass@2 Format)

### Overview
The pass@2 submission format is required for the ARC Prize 2025 competition on Kaggle. It submits 2 diverse attempts per test input, and the score is 1 if at least one matches the ground truth.

### Implementation (Phase 2.5 - October 31, 2025)

**Module**: `src/arc_prometheus/evolutionary_engine/submission_formatter.py`

**Core Functions**:
1. `select_diverse_solvers(generations, num_attempts=2, diversity_metric="fitness")`:
   - Selects diverse solvers from evolution generation history
   - Removes duplicate code before selection
   - Default: fitness-based (best + second-best solver)
   - Alternative: generation_gap (early + late generation)
   - Raises `ValueError` if insufficient unique solvers

2. `generate_task_predictions(task_json_path, solver_codes, timeout=5, sandbox_mode="multiprocess")`:
   - Applies each solver to all test inputs in the task
   - Handles variable test input counts (0-3 per task)
   - Returns `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` placeholder for failed solvers
   - Converts numpy arrays to Python lists for JSON serialization

3. `format_submission_json(task_predictions)`:
   - Validates structure matches Kaggle requirements
   - Returns submission dict ready for json.dump()

**Usage via Benchmark Script**:
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_evolution.py \
  --random-sample 120 \
  --training-data data/arc-prize-2025/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges_merged.json \
  --output-dir results/kaggle_submission/ \
  --experiment-name "kaggle_submission" \
  --generate-submission \
  --num-attempts 2
```

**Output Format** (matches `sample_submission.json`):
```json
{
  "task_id": [
    {"attempt_1": [[grid]], "attempt_2": [[grid]]},  // Test input 0
    {"attempt_1": [[grid]], "attempt_2": [[grid]]},  // Test input 1 (if exists)
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Diversity Strategy**:
- Primary: Select best fitness and second-best fitness solvers
- Fallback: If <2 unique solvers exist, duplicate the best solver (with warning)
- This handles cases where evolution produces nearly identical code

**Validation**:
- Automatic format validation in benchmark script
- Checks: dict structure, list per task, attempt_1/attempt_2 keys, JSON serializable
- Test coverage: 18 unit tests in `tests/test_submission_formatter.py`

**Real API Testing** (October 31, 2025):
- Tested with 3 tasks using Gemini API
- Results: 3/3 successful, submission.json generated, format validated ✅
- No timeouts, truncation, or invalid values ✅
- Diversity: 2/3 tasks had different attempts, 1/3 identical (expected)
