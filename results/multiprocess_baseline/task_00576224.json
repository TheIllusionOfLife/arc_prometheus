Repeating each row twice and concatenating them.\n    2. Repeating the resulting grid vertically twice.\n    3. Swapping the first two rows with the next two rows, and so on.\n    4. Within each pair of rows, swapping the elements of the original rows.\n\n    Let's re-examine the examples:\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input:\n    [[7, 9],\n     [4, 3]]\n\n    Output:\n    [[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9],\n     [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3],\n     [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7],\n     [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4],\n     [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9],\n     [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]]\n\n    This suggests a pattern of:\n    Row 0, Row 1, Row 0 (swapped), Row 1 (swapped), Row 0, Row 1\n\n    Let's generalize this:\n    If input is `[[r0_c0, r0_c1], [r1_c0, r1_c1]]`\n    Output row 0: `[r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1]` (Row 0 repeated 3 times)\n    Output row 1: `[r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1]` (Row 1 repeated 3 times)\n    Output row 2: `[r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0]` (Row 0 with elements swapped, repeated 3 times)\n    Output row 3: `[r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0]` (Row 1 with elements swapped, repeated 3 times)\n    Output row 4: `[r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1, r0_c0, r0_c1]` (Row 0 repeated 3 times)\n    Output row 5: `[r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1, r1_c0, r1_c1]` (Row 1 repeated 3 times)\n\n    This pattern is consistent for both examples. The output grid has a fixed height of 6.\n    The width of the output grid is 3 times the width of the input grid.\n\n    The transformation can be broken down as follows:\n    1. For each row in the input, create a new row by repeating the original row 3 times horizontally.\n    2. Create a \"swapped\" version of each original row by reversing the elements within that row.\n    3. For each swapped row, create a new row by repeating the swapped row 3 times horizontally.\n    4. Concatenate the resulting rows in the order: original_row_0_repeated, original_row_1_repeated,\n       swapped_row_0_repeated, swapped_row_1_repeated, original_row_0_repeated, original_row_1_repeated.\n\n    This assumes the input grid is always 2x2. If the input can be of different sizes,\n    the logic for swapping and repeating needs to be more general. However, based on the\n    examples, it's a 2x2 input leading to a 6x6 output.\n\n    Let's assume the input is always 2x2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if task_grid.size == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n\n    # Assuming input is always 2x2 based on examples\n    row0 = task_grid[0, :]\n    row1 = task_grid[1, :]\n\n    # Repeat each row 3 times horizontally\n    repeated_row0 = np.tile(row0, 3)\n    repeated_row1 = np.tile(row1, 3)\n\n    # Create swapped versions of the rows\n    # The original code was flipping the entire row, which is correct for 2 columns.\n    # If the input had more columns, this would still be the correct interpretation\n    # of \"swapping elements\" within a row for this specific pattern.\n    swapped_row0 = np.flip(row0)\n    swapped_row1 = np.flip(row1)\n\n    # Repeat the swapped rows 3 times horizontally\n    repeated_swapped_row0 = np.tile(swapped_row0, 3)\n    repeated_swapped_row1 = np.tile(swapped_row1, 3)\n\n    # Concatenate the rows in the specified order\n    output_grid = np.vstack([\n        repeated_row0,\n        repeated_row1,\n        repeated_swapped_row0,\n        repeated_swapped_row1,\n        repeated_row0,\n        repeated_row1\n    ])\n\n    return output_grid",
