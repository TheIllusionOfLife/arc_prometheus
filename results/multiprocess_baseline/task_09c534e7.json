Identifying contiguous regions of non-zero pixels.\n    2. For each region, determining its bounding box.\n    3. Within the bounding box, if the region is a simple shape (like a rectangle or a line),\n       it might be filled or expanded.\n    4. Specific colors might be preserved or changed based on their position or relation to other colors.\n    5. The transformation seems to be localized to specific shapes and their internal structure.\n\n    This implementation attempts to capture a common pattern observed:\n    - Identifying connected components of non-zero pixels.\n    - For each component, finding its bounding box.\n    - If a component is a simple horizontal or vertical line, it might be \"thickened\" or filled.\n    - Colors within the bounding box are adjusted based on proximity to the original non-zero pixels.\n    - Specifically, it seems to expand single pixels to 2x2 blocks and fill in some gaps.\n    - It also appears to handle cases where a single pixel is surrounded by a specific color,\n      and it might expand that single pixel.\n\n    This is a heuristic approach based on limited examples and may not generalize to all ARC tasks.\n    The specific logic for color changes (e.g., 1 to 2, 3 to 4) is inferred from the examples.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if task_grid.size == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n\n    rows, cols = task_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.copy(task_grid)\n\n    # Find all non-zero pixels\n    non_zero_coords = np.argwhere(task_grid > 0)\n\n    if non_zero_coords.size == 0:\n        return np.zeros_like(task_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each non-zero pixel and apply transformations\n    for r, c in non_zero_coords:\n        current_color = task_grid[r, c]\n\n        # Example 1 and 2 specific transformations:\n        # If a single pixel (color 1) is surrounded by 0s, it might become a 2x2 block of 2s.\n        if current_color == 1:\n            neighbors = []\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                        continue\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                        neighbors.append(task_grid[nr, nc])\n                    else:\n                        neighbors.append(0) # Treat out of bounds as 0\n\n            # Heuristic: If a '1' is surrounded by '0's, expand it.\n            if all(n == 0 for n in neighbors):\n                for dr in [0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [0, 1]:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            output_grid[nr, nc] = 2\n\n            # Heuristic: If a '1' is surrounded by '1's and '0's, and has a '3' nearby,\n            # it might expand to '3's.
