The 5 is removed.\n    The transformation might be related to the *presence* of 1s and their positions relative to 5.\n\n    Let's look at Example 1 again:\n    Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0] -> [0, 2, 0]\n    The 5 splits the row.\n    Left of 5: [1, 1, 0]. The first 1 is at index 0. The second 1 is at index 1.\n    Right of 5: [0, 1, 0]. The 1 is at index 5 (original index).\n\n    Consider the output [0, 2, 0].\n    The 2 is at index 1. This corresponds to the second '1' in the input row.\n    The first row has two 1s before the 5. The output has a 2 at index 1.\n    The first row has one 1 after the 5. The output has a 2 at index 1.\n\n    This is confusing. Let's try to find a simpler pattern.\n\n    What if the output grid's dimensions are determined by the number of 5s?\n    Example 1: 3 rows, one 5 per row. Output is 3x3.\n    Example 2: 3 rows, one 5 per row. Output is 3x3.\n    Example 3: 3 rows, one 5 per row. Output is 3x3.\n\n    This suggests the output grid has the same number of rows as the input.\n    The number of columns in the output might be related to the number of 5s.\n    If there's one 5 per row, the output has 3 columns.\n\n    Let's analyze Example 1 row by row:\n    Input row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    Output row 1: [0, 2, 0]\n    The 5 is at index 3.\n    Elements before 5: [1, 1, 0]\n    Elements after 5: [0, 1, 0]\n\n    If we consider the *indices* of the 1s relative to the 5:\n    Before 5: 1s at original indices 0, 1.\n    After 5: 1 at original index 5.\n\n    Output [0, 2, 0]. The 2 is at index 1.\n    This index 1 in the output corresponds to the *second* '1' encountered in the row,\n    regardless of whether it's before or after the 5.\n\n    Let's test this hypothesis on Example 1:\n    Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    1s are at indices: 0, 1, 5.\n    If we consider these as a sequence: 1st '1' (index 0), 2nd '1' (index 1), 3rd '1' (index 5).\n    Output row 1: [0, 2, 0]. The 2 is at index 1. This is the *second* '1' in the sequence.\n\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n    1s are at indices: 2, 4, 5, 6.\n    Sequence of 1s: 1st (index 2), 2nd (index 4), 3rd (index 5), 4th (index 6).\n    Output row 2: [0, 0, 2]. The 2 is at index 2. This is the *third* '1' in the sequence.\n\n    Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    1s are at indices: 0, 1, 5.\n    Sequence of 1s: 1st (index 0), 2nd (index 1), 3rd (index 5).\n    Output row 3: [0, 2, 0]. The 2 is at index 1. This is the *second* '1' in the sequence.\n\n    This hypothesis seems to work for Example 1. The output column index of the '2' corresponds to the *rank* of the '1' in the input row, minus 1.\n    The output grid has the same number of rows. The number of columns is determined by the maximum rank of a '1' in any row.\n\n    Let's re-check Example 2:\n    Input:\n    1 0 0 5 0 1 0\n    0 1 0 5 1 1 1\n    1 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\n    Output:\n    0 0 0\n    0 2 0\n    0 0 0\n\n    Row 1: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    1s at indices: 0, 5.\n    Sequence: 1st (index 0), 2nd (index 5).\n    Output row 1: [0, 0, 0]. No '2' is present. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n\n    The hypothesis about the rank of '1's seems incorrect or incomplete.\n\n    Let's look at the *structure* of the output. It's sparse, with at most one '2' per row.\n    The '2' appears to be placed at a specific index.\n\n    Consider the number of '1's before the '5' and after the '5'.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    Before 5: [1, 1, 0] (two 1s)\n    After 5: [0, 1, 0] (one 1)\n    Output row 1: [0, 2, 0]. The '2' is at index 1.\n\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n    Before 5: [0, 0, 1] (one 1)\n    After 5: [1, 1, 1] (three 1s)\n    Output row 2: [0, 0, 2]. The '2' is at index 2.\n\n    Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    Before 5: [1, 1, 0] (two 1s)\n    After 5: [0, 1, 0] (one 1)\n    Output row 3: [0, 2, 0]. The '2' is at index 1.\n\n    It seems the output column index of the '2' is related to the *count* of '1's",

The '2' is at index 1. This matches `ones_before - 1`.\n\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n    Index of 5: 3\n    Before 5: [0, 0, 1] -> ones_before = 1\n    After 5: [1, 1, 1] -> ones_after = 3\n    Output row 2: [0, 0, 2]. The '2' is at index 2. This matches `ones_after - 1` if we consider the '2' to be placed based on the segment that has more '1's, or if it's placed based on the *last* '1' before the 5 if there are any.\n    The output column index of '2' seems to be `max(ones_before, ones_after) - 1` if there are any 1s.\n    Let's try:\n    Row 1: max(2, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Output: [0, 2, 0]. Correct.\n    Row 2: max(1, 3) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Output: [0, 0, 2]. Correct.\n    Row 3: max(2, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Output: [0, 2, 0]. Correct.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Row 1: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n    Index of 5: 3\n    Before 5: [1, 0, 0] -> ones_before = 1\n    After 5: [0, 1, 0] -> ones_after = 1\n    Output row 1: [0, 0, 0]. No '2'. This contradicts the `max(ones_before, ones_after) - 1` rule.\n\n    The rule is likely simpler:\n    For each row, find the index of '5'.\n    Count the number of '1's *before* the '5'. Let this be `count_before`.\n    Count the number of '1's *after* the '5'. Let this be `count_after`.\n    The output row will have a '2' at index `count_before` if `count_before > 0`.\n    If `count_before == 0` and `count_after > 0`, the '2' is at index `count_after - 1`.\n    This is still not quite right.\n\n    Let's consider the *position* of the '2' in the output.\n    Example 1:\n    Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0] -> [0, 2, 0] (2 at index 1)\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1] -> [0, 0, 2] (2 at index 2)\n    Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0] -> [0, 2, 0] (2 at index 1)\n\n    The number of columns in the output seems to be determined by the maximum number of '1's in any segment (before or after '5') across all rows.\n    Let's find the maximum number of '1's in any segment before or after a '5' across all rows.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Row 1: before: 2 ones, after: 1 one. Max segment ones = 2.\n    Row 2: before: 1 one, after: 3 ones. Max segment ones = 3.\n    Row 3: before: 2 ones, after: 1 one. Max segment ones = 2.\n    Overall max segment ones = 3. Output columns = 3.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Row 1: before: 1 one, after: 1 one. Max segment ones = 1.\n    Row 2: before: 1 one, after: 3 ones. Max segment ones = 3.\n    Row 3: before: 0 ones, after: 0 ones. Max segment ones = 0.\n    Overall max segment ones = 3. Output columns = 3.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Row 1: before: 0 ones, after: 0 ones. Max segment ones = 0.\n    Row 2: before: 2 ones, after: 2 ones. Max segment ones = 2.\n    Row 3: before: 1 one, after: 2 ones. Max segment ones = 2.\n    Overall max segment ones = 2. Output columns = 2. This doesn't match example 3 output columns (which is 3).\n\n    Let's go back to the simplest observation: the '2' appears at a specific index.\n    The number of columns in the output is consistent for each example.\n    Example 1: 3 columns.\n    Example 2: 3 columns.\n    Example 3: 3 columns.\n\n    This suggests the output grid has the same number of rows as the input.\n    The number of columns in the output is constant for these examples (3).\n    Let's assume the output width is fixed at 3 for these examples.\n\n    For each row:\n    1. Find the index of '5'.\n    2. Extract the part before '5' and the part after '5'.\n    3. Count the number of '1's in the part before '5' (`ones_before`).\n    4. Count the number of '1's in the part after '5' (`ones_after`).\n    5. If `ones_before > 0`, place a '2' at index `ones_before - 1` in the output row.\n    6. If `ones_before == 0` and `ones_after > 0`, place a '2' at index `ones_after - 1` in the output row.\n    7. If `ones_before > 0` and `ones_after > 0`, the rule for placing '2' needs clarification.\n\n    Let's re-examine Example 3:\n    Input:\n    0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 5 1 0 1\n    0 1 1 5 1 0 1\n\n    Output:\n    0 0 0\n    2 0 0\n    0 0 2\n\n    Row 1: [0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n    Index of 5: 3\n    Before 5: [0, 0, 1] -> ones_before = 1\n    After 5: [0, 0, 0] -> ones_after = 0\n    Output row 1: [0, 0, 0]. No '2'. This is consistent if `ones_before` dictates the position.\n\n    Row 2: [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1]\n    Index of 5: 3\n    Before 5: [1, 1, 0] -> ones_before = 2\n    After 5: [1, 0, 1] -> ones_after = 2\n    Output row 2: [2, 0, 0]. The '2' is at index 0.\n    This suggests if `ones_before > 0`, the '2' is at index `ones_before - 1`.\n    Here, `ones_before = 2`, so `ones_before - 1 = 1`. This doesn't match index 0.\n\n    There must be a simpler interpretation of the '2' placement.\n    The '2' seems to mark the *boundary* or *extent* of the '1's.\n\n    Let's consider the number of '1's before and after the '5' again, and the output column index of '2'.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Row 1: ones_before=2, ones_after=1. Output: [0, 2, 0] (2 at index 1).\n    Row 2: ones_before=1, ones_after=3. Output: [0, 0, 2] (2 at index 2).\n    Row 3: ones_before=2, ones_after=1. Output: [0, 2, 0] (2 at index 1).\n\n    Example 3:\n    Row 1: ones_before=1, ones_after=0. Output: [0, 0, 0].\n    Row 2: ones_before=2, ones_after=2. Output: [2, 0, 0] (2 at index 0).\n    Row 3: ones_before=1, ones_after=2. Output: [0, 0, 2] (2 at index 2).\n\n    Observation:\n    - If `ones_before > 0` and `ones_after == 0`: The '2' is at index `ones_before - 1`. (Example 3, Row 1 - no '2' though, this rule is flawed).\n    - If `ones_before == 0` and `ones_after > 0`: The '2' is at index `ones_after - 1`. (Example 3, Row 3: ones_before=1, ones_after=2. Output 2 at index 2. This rule is also flawed).\n\n    Let's focus on the *position* of the '2' relative to the '5'.\n    The '2' seems to be placed at an index that represents the *count* of '1's in one of the segments.\n\n    Consider the number of '1's *before* the '5'.\n    Example 1:\n    Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]. '1's before 5: at indices 0, 1. Count = 2. Output: [0, 2, 0]. '2' at index 1.\n    Row",
